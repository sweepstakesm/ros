Since last August I think I only got the manual vacuum out maybe three times to take care of hard to reach corners. Having the vacuum makes such a difference. We have cats and they always make a mess around the litter box but with the roomba I just schedule a daily cleaning of that area before I come home and I no longer have to stress about it! We were recently having some issues with the robots battery and I reached out to the customer service  and they responded quickly and sent us a new battery in no time! 
Just trust me when I say this... you NEED this vacuum in your life.">

            <meta itemprop="description" content="My i755 + started bumping into furniture and damaging the paint on a dresser and night tables after a few useS. Following some troubleshooting, Tech Support agreed to send a replacement since it was still under warranty. They assured me it would be the same model and it would be brand new. I called today to install the replacement unit, and there were numerous issues, the worst of all being that my 755+ was replaced by a 715 and Tech Support in the Caribbean insisted that it is the same. First they had me take it apart to change the battery from the original into the replacement one, then since the charging station was not accepting it because it has a different charging station that does not automatically empty the bin, they had me reboot my router, then they realized that the issue was the bin was different, so they had me replace the bin from the old one to the new one, finally, they troubleshooted it over and over until they got it to make the aspiration sound to automatically empty the bin. When I tried to place the original one in the box from the replacement one, it did not fit properly because they are not even the same size! Yet Tech Support in the Caribbean INSISTS that it is the exact same. I spent over an hour on the phone for them to make do with a replacement, which is NOT a replacement as it is the 715 instead of what I paid for which was the 755!!! I was not allowed to speak to a supervisor.
This is disappointing but above all it seems unethical. I have another Roomba, I also have the Brava 380t. After this experience I will never buy another iRobot product again.">

I follow it around picking up clumps all over the place. The hair that it does pick up gets tied up in the rollers and eventually stops the machine from running. If it gets clogged too much it will break the end of the roller. The old roomba with the brush heads did a much better job. I would NOT recommend this product for anybody with a pet. Expensive mistake on my part. Don&#39;t make the same on your end.">

The i8 unit leaves dog fur clumps -everywhere- ...it just seems to push dog fur around. It is far noisier than the eufy L70, has no suction H/M/L option and dies before it gets to the base.  It also has not yet self emptied into the bin as promised (but the app tells us it needs it).  Feels like a $600+ poorly functioning robo vac.

Keep doing everything they ask (clean front wheel, remove and replace side brush, clean inside brushes, send videos, on and on). I paid hundreds of dollars and this should just work! Now they are sending replacement front wheel and cleaning head. Also, clumps of dog hair get left behind in numerous places after it just emptied the bin. Never had this issue with other roombas (this is 3rd I&#39;ve owned, others were great).

I think this one is a lemon and just want a complete replacement. 😩">

            <meta itemprop="description" content="Mine is a household with a little busy kid and a cat (not a heavy shedder since we brush him every day), so it doesn&#39;t get extremely dirty but I do have a severe dust allergy so I try going the extra mile to keep everything as clean as possible. The i7 is noticeably quieter than previous models, does a great job at self-emptying and has awesome suction power; it&#39;s great to be able to send it to clean one particular room in the house or list cleaning areas in different order so I can better accommodate to my work meetings schedule with working from home. However, it misses spots all the time around the house, either corners or random areas on the plain flat floor where there&#39;s no obstacles; but the one that bothers me especially is the 1 sq ft to the right of it&#39;s base, which after 3 weeks it didn&#39;t get cleaned at all, not even once. There&#39;s a total of 3ft obstacle free area to each side of where the base stands so I really don&#39;t know why it doesn&#39;t even go there. I started sweeping that area and any other obvious missed spots around the house after it finishes each job once I noticed this isn&#39;t going to get better. Not too much of my time put into daily sweeping, but I didn&#39;t use to need to do this at all with my previous robot.

I also have another Roomba, a 900 Series I bought in 2018, and I strongly believe this one cleans way better than the new i7 model; plus: it doesn&#39;t miss spots at all. I have it cleaning the basement, which has a much heavier dirt level than my house floor, but I used to have it cleaning around the house, same area as the current i7 I am rating, and my S900 it&#39;s still performing wonderfully. If it had a self-emptying system, I would return the i7 in a heartbeat and get another S900 one. The mapping features and the noise level are not a deal breaker if I know there won&#39;t be missed spots around the house.">

                                    <p><strong>Q.</strong> What is Imprint Smart Mapping?</p>
                                    <p><strong>A:</strong> Smart Mapping technology describes the robot's ability to learn, map and adapt to your home. Roomba i7 learns your floorplan as it cleans and remembers this map for future cleaning jobs - this enables the robot to determine the best way to clean based on the orientation of each room, furniture placement, etc. Once the robot has learned your space and you have labeled your rooms, your Smart Map also enables you to clean a room, multiple rooms, or an entire level of your home all from the iRobot HOME App.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Q.</strong> How does Roomba i7 build its Smart Map and know your rooms?</p>
                                    <p><strong>A.</strong> Roomba i7 builds a map of the area each time it starts a new cleaning job. After cleaning the same space a few times, Roomba i7 will produce a Smart Map that is pre-segmented into different spaces or rooms. This map can be customized in the iRobot HOME App. You can merge, split and label rooms as you see fit. After that, you can schedule the Roomba i7 to clean certain rooms at certain times, or have the robot clean an entire level of your home.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Q.</strong> Can the Roomba i7 remember more than one floor plan?</p>
                                    <p><strong>A.</strong> Yes! The Roomba i7 can remember up to 10 unique floor plans, so you can carry the robot to a different floor or a different home. As long at the robot has mapped the space, it will recognize its location and clean as directed.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Q.</strong> How often does the Clean Base need to be emptied?</p>
                                    <p><strong>A.</strong> Clean Base is designed to hold 30 robot bins of dirt and debris. For some households, this might be one month, for others it could be longer. Results vary based on floor surfaces, whether or not you have pets, etc. Once the bag is full, you will be notified via the iRobot HOME App and you can simply remove it and replace it with a new one.</p>

                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Q.</strong> Does the Clean Base work with previous Roomba models?</p>
                                    <p><strong>A.</strong> No, Clean Base Automatic Dirt Disposal only works with a Roomba i7. Roomba i7 is equipped with a dust bin that is specially designed for use with the dirt disposal unit.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the robot bin dishwasher safe?</p>
                                    <p><strong>A:</strong> No. The washable bin should be rinsed by hand using warm water. Important: Be sure to remove the filter before rinsing the bin. Allow bin to dry completely before reinstalling the filter.</p>
